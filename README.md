# Linphone Plugin

### What is it?

Linphone Plugin is a Locale/Tasker plugin to activate or deactivate sip accounts on the Linphone app.

### Dependencies

Linphone Plugin depends on the locale plugin library available on the Locale developer website (http://www.twofortyfouram.com/developer.html). Simply download a sample project and you get the library.

This plugin is based on the CSipSimple-plugin by luklanis, but updated to support linphone (linphone was updated to add the hook required for this in release 3.2.5)
